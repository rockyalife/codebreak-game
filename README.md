# Codebreak - A Beer Grabber 2D Java game

Welcome to Codebreak, the Java arcade game where the objective is to grab all the beers! Keep an eye on your score, and make sure to avoid all the objects that aren't beers – in particular, bottles of wine. If you catch any of the wrong objects, you'll lose lives.

## How to Play

To play Codebreak, simply run the `codebreak.java` file. Use the arrow keys to move the player and catch the falling beers. Avoid the objects that aren't beers – in particular, bottles of wine – if you catch one of these, you'll lose a life. The game is over when you run out of lives.

## Scoring

Each beer you catch will add 10 points to your score. If you catch a bottle of wine, you'll lose a life. The game is over when you run out of lives.

## Good luck!

We hope you have a great time playing Codebreak. Don't forget to avoid the wine bottles and keep an eye on your lives – and most importantly, grab as many beers as you can to rack up those points!
